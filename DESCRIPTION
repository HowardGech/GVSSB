Description: This package implements the group variational spike-and-slab Bayes (GVSSB) method for high-dimensional variable selection. The GVSSB method is a Bayesian approach that uses a variational inference algorithm to estimate the posterior distribution of the model parameters. It is designed to handle high-dimensional data with a large number of predictors and can be used for both linear and additive models.
